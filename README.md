# Tinky-Cookbook

A Cookbook of handy patterns for use with [Tinky](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Tinky)

## Introduction

While I was writing about
[Tinky](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Tinky) for a [Perl 6 Advent
Post](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/day-18-asynchronous-workflow-with-tinky/)
I tried out a lot of examples and patterns that I decided wouldn't fit
in the article so I concluded that it would be nice to make something separate that
could contain these examples to help people get the most out the module.

This is likely to be a constant work in progress, so if you have any suggestions
as to patterns or examples that you would like to see please feel free to add
an issue to this repository.
